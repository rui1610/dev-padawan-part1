# Dev Padawan - Part 1

This file is a so called [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file. It's good pratice to provide such a file in a github repository, so that developers who cloned this repo know how to use it.

In addition the format renders nicely in Github without having to know how to write html files.

If you want to become a Dev Jedi you should look into some markdown cheat sheets like [this one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or [this one](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

## Pre-requisites

To start your developer training you first need to finish the following three tasks

- task 1: [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - this will be your development environment
- task 2: [Install a Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - you need it to access the code samples
- task 3: [Install a docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) - you need 

## Your homework

Try creating a nice looking new markdown file within the repository you have cloned and let it render in your Visual Studio Code environment.

~~Try to~~ Install a markdown extension in VS Code and find out how to preview the file there. Google will tell you how to do that.

It should look like this screenshot:
